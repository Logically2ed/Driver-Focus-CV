# Driver-Focus-CV

### Questions to answer:
I want to know how viable it is to check how many people are actively paying attention to something other than the road.

What circumstances are surrounding the driving condition?

What data can be gathered from this research?

Can this be done real time?

If so, how many parameters can be calculated on the fly and what is its accuracy?
